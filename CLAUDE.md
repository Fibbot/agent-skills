ALWAYS update the CLAUDE.md with any new or relevant information from our settings.

As the last stage of implementing a stage, always use staffEngineer.md to verify and assure your work is up to our standards.

Always output a "testPlan.md" for the manual tester to run through and verify fixes and/or updates.


### Memory and Learning
- At the start of every session, read `lessons.md` to internalize project-specific patterns and past mistakes.
- Whenever I provide a correction or you discover a non-obvious solution, propose a new entry for `lessons.md` summarizing the failure mode and the "lesson" to prevent it.
- Keep `lessons.md` concise and high-signal; prioritize patterns over one-off instances.
