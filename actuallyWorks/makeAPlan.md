# Your task:

Create a staged implementation plan that takes this project from zero to a working local development POC. Output this as a markdown document called IMPLEMENTATION_STAGES.md.

Requirements for the stages:

1. Each stage should be a discrete, completable unit of work that results in something runnable/testable
2. Stages should be sequential - each builds on the previous
3. Keep stages small enough to fit in a single context window session
4. Include what "done" looks like for each stage (acceptance criteria)

Do not implement anything yet. Only produce the staged plan document. Do not fill in ambiguous information. If a step requires information you do not explicitly know the user wanted, ask for clarification before putting pen to paper. Ideally iterate through any outstanding questions and use those answers to finalize your IMPLEMENTATION_STAGES.md document.
