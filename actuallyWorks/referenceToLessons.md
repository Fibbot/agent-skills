### Memory and Learning
- At the start of every session, read `lessons.md` to internalize project-specific patterns and past mistakes.
- Whenever I provide a correction or you discover a non-obvious solution, propose a new entry for `lessons.md` summarizing the failure mode and the "lesson" to prevent it.
- Keep `lessons.md` concise and high-signal; prioritize patterns over one-off instances.
